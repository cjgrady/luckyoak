# Lucky Oak Invitational Website

Source code for the Lucky Oak Golf Invitational Website. This repo is primarily a place for me to experiment with JavaScript
and CSS while potentially creating an interesting framework for other annual events to use.

The site will be data-driven and perhaps should be split into two repositories, one for the website code and the second for the data.
